# Sleep Alone analysis

This is a dataset analysis run on the survey fivethirtyeight provided in [their repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/sleeping-alone-data).

## Evaluation Goal

While the authors themselves mainly just elaborated if couples would sleep in separated beds and the reason for this choice given by the interviewers themselves, this research focuses if a tendency of sleeping separated can be derived based on the given set of features

## Dependencies

The evaluation is completely run in a [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter) environment. Please ensure the following python packages are installed in order to ensure a smooth operation:

| Plugin | Version |
| ------ | ------ |
| Pandas | 1.4.4 |
| Numpy | 1.21.5 |
| Matplotlib | 3.5.2 |
| Sklearn | 1.0.2 |

Note: it probably should work fine with other packages versions too but a successfull run has only been verified with this configuration on a Windows 11 system with Python 3.9.13

## Start

To run the evaluation, run the notebook on your prefered way. One option is by calling in a terminal

    jupyter notebook evaluation.ipynb
